how to check ports of linux server?
1. Using netstat (if installed)
netstat -tuln
-t: Show TCP connections.
-u: Show UDP connections.
-l: List listening ports.
-n: Show numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames.

2. Using ss (preferred method for modern Linux systems)
ss -tuln
Similar to netstat, it shows all listening TCP and UDP ports.

3. Using lsof (list open files)
lsof -i -P -n
This displays all network connections and their corresponding processes.

4. Using nmap (requires installation)
Install nmap if not already installed:
sudo apt install nmap
Then, scan open ports:
nmap <IP_address>
5. Using iptables (or firewall rules)
You can check open ports based on the configured firewall:
sudo iptables -L -n -v
