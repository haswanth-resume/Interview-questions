3. Difference between availability set and availability region?
Ans:
Availability Sets:
Distributes VMs across fault domains within the same datacenter.
Reduces risk of simultaneous VM downtime due to hardware or update failures.
Applicable only to VMs.
Acceptable downtime: ~22 minutes/month.
Availability Zones:
Spreads VMs across different zones within an Azure region.
Provides 99.99% SLA (less than 5 minutes downtime/month).
Protects VMs from entire datacenter failures.
