1. We are getting secret values error while pushing to the git repo what is the command to resolve that?

2. What is the major issue that resolvedd by yourself?

3. Difference between availability set and availability region?
Ans:
Availability Sets:
Distributes VMs across fault domains within the same datacenter.
Reduces risk of simultaneous VM downtime due to hardware or update failures.
Applicable only to VMs.
Acceptable downtime: ~22 minutes/month.
Availability Zones:
Spreads VMs across different zones within an Azure region.
Provides 99.99% SLA (less than 5 minutes downtime/month).
Protects VMs from entire datacenter failures.
Applicable to various Azure services.

4. Did you created YAML pipeline?
Ans: I have created classic editor without YAML which is template based pipeline
For YAML pipeline:
# Universal Windows Platform
# Build a Universal Windows Platform project using Visual Studio.
# Add steps that test and distribute an app, save build artifacts, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

variables:
  solution: '**/*.sln'
  buildPlatform: 'x64'
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'
  appxPackageDir: '$(build.artifactStagingDirectory)\AppxPackages\\'
