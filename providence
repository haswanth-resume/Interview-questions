different between private endpoints and public endpoints?
Ans: 
Public Endpoint
- Accessibility: Public endpoints are openly accessible over the internet. Anyone with the correct URL or IP address and appropriate credentials (if required) can access them.
- Use Cases: Typically used for services, APIs, or websites meant for public consumption, such as e-commerce sites, social media platforms, or public APIs.
- Security: Extra measures like authentication, encryption, and rate limiting are usually implemented since these endpoints are exposed to a wider audience.
- Network: They exist in publicly accessible zones, like the internet.

Private Endpoint
- Accessibility: Private endpoints are restricted to specific networks, such as a company's intranet or a Virtual Private Network (VPN). They are not directly accessible from the internet.
- Use Cases: Commonly used for internal applications, databases, or services that require controlled access, ensuring sensitive data and functionality remain secure.
- Security: Since they are not exposed to the internet, they inherently offer an additional layer of protection. Access is strictly controlled through network configurations.
- Network: They exist within a private network, often leveraging tools like firewalls or private cloud solutions.
