CI/CD KT:

Solution Integration Reference Environment(Solution Testing)


Products:
APF
BROWSER
HABITAT
SCADA
ADMS


Example APF:
Dev Test
Product Test
Solution Test

DEV stable -> PTE stable -> Solution stable(SIRE) 

Example APF:
Dev Test:
When the new APF software MSI's is released they will be marked as DEV_Stable by CI pipeline.

Production Test:
In this ENV the Dev_Stable version of APF will be tested with SIRE_Stable version of other selective product and on success the product will be marked as PTE_Stable

Solution Test:
In this ENV the PTE_Stable version of APF will be tested with SIRE_Stable versions of all other product and on success the product will be finally marked as SIRE_Stable.

In Devops Dashboard we have:
Templates
habitat
scada
apf
browser
adms


How to check the PTE_Stable and SIRE_Stable version details?
Option1-
Step1: Download the product repos
Step2: CD into one the folder and Run below git fetch command:
git fetch origin "ref/notes/*:refs/notes/*"

Step3: Run command 'gitk'
Step4: this will open new window
Step5: Go to view>>New View>>put below string in "Branch and tags" field
notes/ge/ci/status/DEV_STABLE notes/ge/ci/status/PTE_STABLE
notes/ge/ci/status/SRE_STABLE notes/ge/ci/metadata/artifacts

Option2- Using tags script

How to provision infra from vscode
infra created by provision will use to run our APF role


By 2 ways we can provision infra
1. through pipeline
2. through vscode using ansible (we can create multiple hosts in AWS)



CI/CD doubts

ge.test     -  The roles that are required to installed as pre-req to run test
ge.common   -  all the 3rd arty s/w that are needed as pre-req to install GE software are stored in ge.common
ge.grid     -  This has main playbook that will be executed from CI CD pipeline that deploy all the required software


ge.habitat   - all the ansible roles to install habitat
ge.scada     - all the ansible roles to install scada
ge.apf       - all the ansible roles to install apf
ge.browser   - all the ansible roles to install browser
ge.admss3    - all the ansible roles to install admss3
